# CLI2

## Standard Output Redirection
By default, standard output is displayed on the screen. However, it can be redirected to a file using `>`.
- Example: `ls -lh > file_list.txt`

To view the contents of a file, use `cat`:
- Example: `cat file_list.txt`

### Appending to a File
Use `>>` to append to a file:
- Example: `ls -lh >> file_list.txt`

## Standard Input Redirection
By default, standard input comes from the keyboard. You can use `<` to take input from a file.
- Example: `sort < words.txt > sorted_words.txt`  
  (Sorts `words.txt` and saves the output to `sorted_words.txt`)

## Pipelining
Pipelines (`|`) allow chaining commands, where the output of one command is the input for the next.
- Example: `ls -lh | less`  
  (The output of `ls -lh` is passed to `less`)
- Example: `ls | wc -l`  
  (Counts the number of lines in the output of `ls`)

## Echo Command
The `echo` command displays the text passed to it.
- Example: `echo *`  
  (Displays all files in the current directory)
- Example: `echo ~`  
  (Displays the home directory of the current user)

You can use a backslash (`\`) to break long commands across lines for better readability.

## Permissions

### File Types
- `-rwxrwxrwx`: If the first character is `-`, it’s a regular file. If it's `d`, it's a directory.
  
The next three characters indicate the owner’s permissions (read, write, execute).  
The following three characters represent the group's permissions, and the final three characters represent others' permissions.

### Changing Permissions
Use `chmod` to change permissions:
- Example: `chmod <permissions> <file>`

Permissions are represented as a three-digit number, where each digit corresponds to the owner, group, and others. Each digit is a sum of the binary representation of read, write, and execute permissions:
- Example: `chmod 600 Readme.md`
  - `6 = 110 = rw-` for the owner
  - `0 = 000 = ---` for the group
  - `0 = 000 = ---` for others

- Example: `chmod 777 file`  
  (Grants read, write, and execute permissions to everyone)

### Superuser Privileges
A superuser (or system admin) can execute commands with elevated privileges using `sudo`.
- Example: `sudo <command>`
- To maintain `sudo` status, use: `sudo -i`

## Text Editors
Common CLI-based text editors include:
1. `vi` / `vim`
2. `emacs`
3. `nano`
4. `gedit`
5. `kwrite`

---

## Shell Scripts

To create a shell script using `nano`:
1. Run: `nano myscript.sh`
2. Write the script and save the file.
3. To execute the script: `sh myscript.sh`

---

## Command History

The `history` command shows previously executed commands:
- Example: `history > history_command.txt`  
  (Saves the command history to a file)

---

## Downloading Files

### wget
Use `wget` to download files from a URL.
- Example: `wget <URL>`

### curl
`curl` can be used for downloading and uploading files.
- Example (download): `curl -o horse.jpg <URL>`
- Example (upload): `curl -O <URL>`

---

## grep (Global Regular Expression Print)

`grep` is used to search for patterns within a file.
- Example: `grep "PAT" file.txt`

### Common Options
1. `-i`: Case-insensitive search
2. `-v`: Inverts the match (shows lines without the pattern)
3. `-n`: Displays line numbers
4. `-r`: Recursive search (searches subdirectories)
