# GIT

## Version Control
Version control helps keep track of changes to code or files. Git makes this easier by letting manage all versions within one place.

## Git Stores Data
- **Changes**: Some systems save only changes, which can make it hard to see the whole picture.
- **Snapshots**: Git takes a snapshot of your project at each point, so user can easily go back to any version.

## Three States in Git
1. **Modified**: changed something but didnâ€™t save it in Git yet.
2. **Staged**: marked changes ready to be saved.
3. **Committed**: saved changes in Git's history.

## Setting Up Git
After user install Git, user need to set it up. Use these commands to set user name and email:

git config --global user.name "Name"
git config --global user.email "example@example.com"

These are global settings, which means they apply to all projects on computer.

## Basic Commands
1. **Start Git in a Project**: To track a folder with Git, go into the folder and run:
   
    git init
    
2. **Check Project Status**: To see what files changed or added:
    
    git status
   
3. **Stage Changes**: Get files ready to save:
    
    git add [filename]
    
4. **Save Changes (Commit)**: Commit changes with a message:
    
    git commit -m "message"
    

## Working with Branches
Branches help work on different parts of a project separately. To create a branch and switch to it:

git checkout -b [branch_name]


## Ignoring Files .gitignore
If you add a file you don't want to track to the file '.gitignore', Git ignores it.

Example `.gitignore`:
